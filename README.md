Build an outcome probability distribution 
for roll of N dices with M sides marked from 1 to M.
The result is a map of probabilities of each possible outcome in percents. 

Example:
 
N = 2, m = 2 

cases: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

probability for 2 is .25, for 3 is .5, and for 4 is .25   

result = {2=25, 3=50, 4=25}
